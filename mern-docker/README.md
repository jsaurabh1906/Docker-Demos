# Dockerizing MERN Application
---
This guide provides instructions to create a Dockerfile for both the backend and frontend of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application and includes a compose.yaml file for managing services.

### 1. Backend Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile inside the backend folder:


<details>
<summary><code>backend/Dockerfile</code></summary>

```dockerfile
# Set base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose port for API
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the backend server

CMD npm start
```
</details>

</br>

### 2. Frontend Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile inside the frontend folder:

<details>
<summary><code>frontend/Dockerfile</code></summary>

```dockerfile
# set the base image to create the image for react app
FROM node:23-alpine3.20

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose port for frontend
EXPOSE 5173

# Start the React application
CMD npm run dev
```
</details>

</br>

### 3. compose.yaml file

This file defines and runs multi-container applications. Create a compose.yaml in the root directory of your project:


<details>
<summary><code>Docker compose.yaml file</code></summary>

```yaml
# specify the version of docker-compose
version: "3.8"

# define the services/containers to be run
services:
  # define the frontend service
  # we can use any name for the service. A standard naming convention is to use "web" for the frontend
  web:
    # we use depends_on to specify that service depends on another service
    # in this case, we specify that the web depends on the api service
    # this means that the api service will be started before the web service
    depends_on: 
      - api
    # specify the build context for the web service
    # this is the directory where the Dockerfile for the web service is located
    build: ./frontend
    # specify the ports to expose for the web service
    # the first number is the port on the host machine
    # the second number is the port inside the container
    ports:
      - 5173:5173
    # specify the environment variables for the web service
    # these environment variables will be available inside the container
    environment:
      VITE_API_URL: http://localhost:8000

    # this is for docker compose watch mode
    # anything mentioned under develop will be watched for changes by docker compose watch and it will perform the action mentioned
    develop:
      # we specify the files to watch for changes
      watch:
        # it'll watch for changes in package.json and package-lock.json and rebuild the container if there are any changes
        - path: ./frontend/package.json
          action: rebuild
        - path: ./frontend/package-lock.json
          action: rebuild
        # it'll watch for changes in the frontend directory and sync the changes with the container real time
        - path: ./frontend
          target: /app
          action: sync

  # define the api service/container
  api: 
    # api service depends on the db service so the db service will be started before the api service
    depends_on: 
      - db

    # specify the build context for the api service
    build: ./backend
    
    # specify the ports to expose for the api service
    # the first number is the port on the host machine
    # the second number is the port inside the container
    ports: 
      - 8000:8000

    # specify environment variables for the api service
    # for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance
    environment: 
      DB_URL: mongodb://db/anime
    
    # establish docker compose watch mode for the api service
    develop:
      # specify the files to watch for changes
      watch:
        # it'll watch for changes in package.json and package-lock.json and rebuild the container and image if there are any changes
        - path: ./backend/package.json
          action: rebuild
        - path: ./backend/package-lock.json
          action: rebuild
        
        # it'll watch for changes in the backend directory and sync the changes with the container real time
        - path: ./backend
          target: /app
          action: sync

  # define the db service
  db:
    # specify the image to use for the db service from docker hub. If we have a custom image, we can specify that in this format
    # In the above two services, we're using the build context to build the image for the service from the Dockerfile so we specify the image as "build: ./frontend" or "build: ./backend".
    # but for the db service, we're using the image from docker hub so we specify the image as "image: mongo:latest"
    # you can find the image name and tag for mongodb from docker hub here: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
    image: mongo:latest

    # specify the ports to expose for the db service
    # generally, we do this in api service using mongodb atlas. But for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance
    # usually, mongodb runs on port 27017. So we're exposing the port 27017 on the host machine and mapping it to the port 27017 inside the container
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

    # specify the volumes to mount for the db service
    # we're mounting the volume named "anime" inside the container at /data/db directory
    # this is done so that the data inside the mongodb container is persisted even if the container is stopped
    volumes:
      - anime:/data/db

# define the volumes to be used by the services
volumes:
  anime:

### 4. Docker Commands

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Builds and starts the services defined in docker-compose.yml OR compose.yaml.

- Use -d to run in detached mode.

```bash
docker compose down
```
- Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose.yml OR compose.yaml.
```bash
docker compose watch
```
- Watches for file changes and rebuilds/restarts containers automatically.
