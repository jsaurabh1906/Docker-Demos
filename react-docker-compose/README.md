## Docker Compose Up

### Command:

```sh

- This command starts all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

- To run it in detached mode (background execution), use:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

#### Benefits:

1. Simplifies managing multi-container applications.

2. Handles networking and dependencies automatically.

3. Provides logs and real-time feedback when running services.

## Conclusion
